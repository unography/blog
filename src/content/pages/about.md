Hi! I'm Dhruv
I currently lead the Data Science team at [HelloSivi](https://hellosivi.com), solving Machine Learning + Design problems.
When not building ML models at my day job, I build ML models to make some weird art, [photograph](https://instagram.com/unography) life around me, and worry about my crypto portfolio.

I also create/curate art and aesthetics for [The Unography Mag](https://unographymag.com), a place best described as ~ your local internet art gallery
